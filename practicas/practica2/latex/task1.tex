No, there is no loss of information in the process described by (9).
The upsampling operation in \eqref{eq:upsample} simply inserts $(L-1)$ zeros between consecutive samples of $w[n]$.
Therefore, the original sequence $w[n]$ can be perfectly recovered from the upsampled sequence $\bar{w}[n]$
by taking one sample out of every $L$ samples (i.e., by discarding the inserted zeros).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:upsample}
    \bar{w}[n] =
    \begin{cases}
        w[n/L], & \text{if } n \text{ is an integer multiple of } L, \\[4pt]
        0,      & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
