Implementation of a simple version of the OFDM modulator.

Tested with {\tt N=4} and {\tt Lc=2} with no null subcarriers inserted, then for {\tt data = [4 -1 4 -1 1 4i -1 2i]}, the output {\tt w} should be {\tt w = [ 2.5 0 1.5 0 2.5 0 -1.5i 1 1.5i 0 -1.5i 1 ]} (Why?).
The output {\tt x} will depend on the oversampling factor specified.

\textbf{Question: Explain what the differences are between the outputs {\tt x} and {\tt w}.
