\textbf{An OFDM transceiver has 85 MHz of available RF bandwidth, of which 80 MHz can be occupied for data transmission, leaving $2.5$ MHz at each side as guard bands. The subcarrier spacing is $20$ kHz, and the delay spread of the channel almost never exceeds 6 $\mu$s.

\textbf{Question: What is the smallest possible CP overhead of this system, in percentage?}
\vspace{0.5cm}

$O{_CP} = \frac{L_cT}{NT} = \frac{L_c}{N}$

$\Delta_c = \frac{1}{NT} \rightarrow NT = \frac{1}{\Delta_c}= \frac{1}{20 \times 10^3} = 50 \mu s$

$O{_CP} = \frac{6\mu s}{50 \mu s} = 0.12$
