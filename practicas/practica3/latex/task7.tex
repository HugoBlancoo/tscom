To conclude the assignment, we study the case in which the fluid flow does not remain constant with time; instead, it exhibits random fluctuations, according to
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:rndflow}
 \mbox{[fluid flow at time $nT$]} &=& \mbox{[fluid flow at time $(n-1)T$]} \, + \, \mbox{[random increment]},
\end{eqnarray}
where the random increment is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with standard deviation of 0.35 cm$^3/$s.
