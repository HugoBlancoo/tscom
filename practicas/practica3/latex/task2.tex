\textbf{Question: Show that, for appropriate initial values $\beta_{-1}$ and $\hat\ell_{-1}$ that you should specify, the LMMSE estimate can be computed recursively as
\[  \beta_n = \beta_{n-1} + \alpha c_h^2, \qquad \hat \ell_n = \frac{1}{\beta_n} (\beta_{n-1}\hat \ell_{n-1} + \alpha c_h x_n), \qquad n\geq 0. \]
Using this recursion, how many additions, multiplications and divisions do we need in order to update the estimate with each new observation? Does this load depend on the time index $n$?}

\textbf{Note that if one simply stored all samples in memory and then computed  the LMMSE estimate naively using \eqref{eq:brute} without using recursivity, then the memory size and the number of additions would grow with $n$.}
