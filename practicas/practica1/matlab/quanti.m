function y = quanti(x, FS, Nbits)% function  y = quanti(x, FS, Nbits)%% quantizes the input samples in x to the nearest quantization level% input:%   x      - vector to be quantized%   FS     - Full Scale range (from -FS to +FS)%   Nbits  - No. of bits (including sign bit)%   Quantization is of midtread type, so that we have 2^Nbits levels, %       with lowest level = -FS,       highest level = FS-LSB % output: %   y      - quantized vector FS    = abs(FS);FSbin = 2^(Nbits-1);LSB   = FS/FSbin;    y = round(x/LSB);    y = min(y, FSbin-1);    y = max(y, -FSbin);    y = y * LSB;
